# AryaSoft-BulkRenameUtility

This is my Bulk File Rename Utility. It is written in Python and is useful for renaming a bunch of files.
I made it with the help of Real Python (https://realpython.com/bulk-file-rename-tool-python/?ref=morioh.com&utm_source=morioh.com), which gave me the UI and most of the code.

You can freely use this software. Just download it from the Releases page for your OS and it will work.
