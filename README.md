# AryaSoft-BulkRenameUtility

This is my Bulk File Rename Utility. It is written in Python and is useful for renaming a bunch of files.
I made it with the help of Real Python (https://realpython.com/bulk-file-rename-tool-python/?ref=morioh.com&utm_source=morioh.com), which gave me the UI and most of the code.

This is free software. You can use it however you want, as long as you give credit to me (and RealPython).
